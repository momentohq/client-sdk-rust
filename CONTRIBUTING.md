# Welcome to Momento Rust SDK contributing guide :wave:

Thank you for taking your time to contribute to our Rust SDK!
<br/>
This guide will provide you information to start development and testing.
<br/>
Happy coding :dancer:
<br/>

## Requirements :coffee:

- A modern `cargo` tool chain is required; we love [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)
- A Momento API key is required. You can generate one using the [Momento Console](https://console.gomomento.com)

> :bulb: **Tip** When installing with `rustup`, which we recommend, ensure no other versions of the Rust toolchain are installed on your system (eg via package managers like homebrew). This can lead to puzzling issues with the `cargo` command. Check `which cargo` to ensure you are using the correct version. Uninstall any other versions of Rust if necessary (`brew uninstall rust`).

<br/>

### Installing Momento and Running the Example

Check out [example](./example/) directory!

## Build :computer:

We use `cargo` to build and run other tasks such as linting. See the `Makefile` and the workflows in `.github/workflows` for the exact commands that are run in CI/CD.

Here are the basics:

```bash
# build
make build

# lint
make lint

# run all tests (unit, integration, and doctests)
MOMENTO_API_KEY=<api key> make test

# shortcut to run all of the targets before committing:
MOMENTO_API_KEY=<api key> make
```

## Development ðŸ”¨

At Momento, we believe [exceptions are bugs](https://www.gomomento.com/blog/exceptions-are-bugs). In Rust, this means the
unchecked use of `.unwrap()` calls inherently fills your code with bugs and makes debugging `panic` calls a lot more difficult.

We rigorously check for proper formatting and use `clippy` to check for good code practices as well as avoiding `.unwrap()` calls. Instead, try to use
an alternative, including but not limited to:

- `.expect("descriptive error message")`
- `.unwrap_or_default("default string goes here")`
- Use `?` to have the caller handle the error

### Building

Run this command to verify everything passes so that you can save yourself some time when our GitHub actions are ran against the commit:

```bash
MOMENTO_API_KEY=<api key> make
```

### Tests

There are three different kinds of tests in this repo:

- Unit tests: these are defined via the `#[test]` macro, in the same file as the code they are testing. For an example see `credential_provider.rs`.
- Doc tests: these are defined inside of docstrings. They are intended more for documentation of how users should interact with our SDK than for exhaustive test coverage.
- Integration tests: these live in the `tests` directory, and this is where the lion's share of our test coverage will be.

To run all the tests you can do:

```
MOMENTO_API_KEY=<api key> make test
```

To run only the unit tests:

```
MOMENTO_API_KEY=<api key> make test-unit
```

To run only the doc tests:

```
MOMENTO_API_KEY=<api key> make test-doctests
```

To run only the integration tests:

```
MOMENTO_API_KEY=<api key> make test-integration
```

Note: the flush_cache test runs separately from the other tests as all the integration tests share the same cache and flushing the cache when other tests are running concurrently creates a race condition and nondeterministic behavior.

To run a single file of integration tests:

```
MOMENTO_API_KEY=<api key> cargo test --test 'cache_sorted_set'
```

### How the integration tests are organized

We have organized the integration tests, those in the `tests` folder, first by service and then by functionality.
This makes it easier to find the tests you are looking for and to add new tests in the future. We are intentionally
following the organization model from the [JS repo](https://github.com/momentohq/client-sdk-javascript/packages/common-integration-tests/src).

```
tests
â”œâ”€â”€ cache
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ control.rs
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ item.rs
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ key_existence.rs
|   â”œâ”€â”€ scalar.rs
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ sorted_set.rs
```

That is, we have a `tests` folder with a folder for each service, and then within each service we have a module
for each command group or broader set of functionality (eg sorted sets, scalars, item metadata). Within each module,
we have a list of submodules, one for each individual command. Each of these corresponds to a `describe` block in the
JS tests.

```rust
// example from sorted_set.rs

mod sorted_set_fetch_by_rank {
    // tests for the sorted_set_fetch_by_rank command
}

mod sorted_set_fetch_by_score {
    // tests for the sorted_set_fetch_by_score command
}

mod sorted_set_get_rank {
    // tests for the sorted_set_get_rank command
}

// etc
```

By mirroring the JS structure, we can ensure that the tests are consistent across the two SDKs, and that we can easily
add new tests in the future.

### More details on doctests

Docstring are denoted via `///` comment blocks preceding a function or struct.

Inside of these docstrings you can include code blocks, via `/// \`\`\``.

The code inside of these code blocks will be compiled and executed as part of the doctest execution. This ensures that our docs always have working code; the compile will fail if the docstring code is not valid.j

The resulting docs will be automatically published to https://docs.rs/momento/latest/momento/ . However you may hide certain lines from the published docs by prefixing them with a `#` (`/// #`). Use this liberally to remove extraneous details from the documentation while keeping the code blocks self-contained and syntactically valid.

You can build and examine the docs locally at any time via:

```bash
cargo doc --open
```

The goal of these code snippets is to show users how to use the APIs; they are not intended for
exhaustive test coverage. You can (and should) add `assert` statements if they will help ensure
the code is correct, but these `assert` statements should always be excluded from the published docs
via a `#` comment.
