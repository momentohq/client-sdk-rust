# Momento Rust SDK - AWS Lambda CDK Example

This directory contains an example project defining a Rust-based AWS Lambda function that interacts with the Momento Rust SDK.
The Lambda function is deployed using the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK).

## Example Requirements

- Follow the [installation guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) to install Rust and Cargo.
- You will also need the [cargo-lambda cargo extension](https://www.cargo-lambda.info/)
- The CDK code in this repo is written in TypeScript, so you will need `Node.js` version 16 or later, and a compatible
  version of `npm` installed. If you don't have these, we recommend [nodenv](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv).
- To get started with Momento you will need a Momento API key. You can get one from the [Momento Console](https://console.gomomento.com).

## Building and Deploying the Lambda Function

To build and deploy the Lambda function, first make sure that your AWS credentials are set up properly (via env vars or
~/.aws/credentials file). Then all you need to do is run the following commands:

```bash
cd infrastructure
npm ci
npm run cdk -- deploy --parameters MomentoApiKey=<YOUR_MOMENTO_API_KEY>
```

After the lambda is deployed, you can visit the AWS console and click the "Test" button to run it! The function will
do a simple Momento cache set followed by a cache get, and log the results.

## Interesting Files in this Example

- `infrastructure/lib/MomentoSimpleLambdaStack.ts` - this is the CDK stack that defines the Lambda function and its
  associated resources. It uses the `RustFunction` construct from the `cargo-lambda-cdk` package.
- `lambda/momento-simple-lambda/Cargo.toml` - this is the Cargo.toml file for the Lambda function. It includes the `lambda_runtime`
  crate as a dependency; this makes it easy to write Lambda functions in Rust. It also includes the `lazy_static` crate,
  which allows us to re-use the Momento client object across multiple function invocations.
- `lambda/momento_simple_lambda/src/main.rs` - this is the Rust code for the Lambda function. It uses the AWS `lambda_runtime`
  crate to implement the `main` function in a way that is compatible with AWS's provided Amazon Linux runtimes.
